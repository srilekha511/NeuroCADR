NeuroCADR: A novel computational approach for drug repositioning using KNN and spherical k-means to reveal drug candidates for epilepsy

The traditional method of developing drugs is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Drug repositioning involves the reassignment of existing drugs for novel therapeutic purposes through serendipitous, clinical, and in silico approaches. It is cheaper, faster, and more successful than traditional drug development. This project utilized an in silico approach, in which databases of drugs and chemical information were used to identify potential drug candidates.

Hypothesis: Utilizing KNN (k-nearest neighbor) algorithms and spherical k-means to perform drug repositioning would result in more potential repurposed drug candidates and more accurate drug predictions as the combination of supervised and unsupervised ML for classification and clustering will allow for more functionality that can be used to treat epilepsy.
